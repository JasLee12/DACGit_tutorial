# DAC Dacademy
Dacademy was a program taught by the Data Analysis Club EXCO members. I attended the program in 2022 and taught the new batch of members in 2023. 

## Introduction
Hi! This repository was created as part of DAC's Git tutorial, as seen from its name. But I decided to put the other tutorials from Dacademy in as well. The materials that I used to teach my sessions will also be in this repository under folder name 2023.

## Format
The code taught in Dacademy is primarily python using Jupyter notebook or Google Colab.

## Curriculum
1. Introduction to Python
